            <h3>Five Three One</h3>

            Have you ever felt the need to decide on a something, like a place to eat, but for 
            some reason you just couldn't get your mind to cooperate? Making a list of places 
            can sometimes be a lot easier than deciding on some place from that list, especially 
            when the choice seems arbitrary. Fewer choices makes things easier, especially when 
            someone (or something) is enabling your choices by narrowing it down.<br />
            If this has happened to you, then my Five Three One tool is for you! Just enter five 
            choices, and this tool will help you narrow it down to three!
