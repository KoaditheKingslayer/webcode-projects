This is a website I created while learning and playing with JavaScript. 
My aim wasn't to make it super beautiful, though I wanted to show at least some understanding of HTML and CSS with it,
as well as the JavaScript I was learning. None of these are big projects. They're largely single-page projects, each
of which accomplish a single task or display a single principal.
